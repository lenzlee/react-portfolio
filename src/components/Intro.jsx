        <h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="introText">
        <p>I am a senior web developer for the University Marketing and Communication's (UMC) Digital Team at Loyola University Chicago. My main role is managing our web content management system, TerminalFour/T4. I also help manage major web projects and contribute strategic marketing vision to the evolution of the Universityâ€™s Web site.

</p><p>I specifically focus on supporting UMC clients through the continued development of technology resources. I work towards making sure Loyola's Site Content Coordinators have the tools and resources needed to achieve their marketing goals as we advance the use of TerminalFour Site Manager, WordPress, and the many other tools that we use in UMC. I use my technology and marketing acumen to use technology to achieve marketing goals.</p>

<p>
I live in the Chicagoland area and I love my city! I spend my free time and weekends with my family especially with my nieces and nephews. I love Karaoke and I love watching professional golf. Jordan Spieth and Viktor Hovland are my favorites on the PGA tour. I also love to travel especially to Europe. I fell in love with Italy when I first traveled there and I have been back there a few times since. Rome is my favorite!</p>
